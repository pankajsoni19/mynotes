// D18: browser Back/Forward while an in-app dialog or sheet is open only closes it. Dialogs push no
// history entry, so the open app registers a guard that closes its dialog and then undoes the
// browser's move with history.go(), whose own popstate is ignored once. Every popstate handler asks
// first, so the first one to see the event runs the guard and the others skip it. Listener order on
// window is registration order, which is why this is a shared check instead of a capture-phase listener.
//
// The one exception is an entry at depth 0 on a phone (a fresh load of `/` or a deep link): there is
// no in-app entry below it, so Back would leave Nook before any popstate could close the dialog.
// Opening a guarded dialog there pushes one sentinel entry (same URL, depth 1, a `mynotes.dialog`
// hint); Back pops it and only closes the dialog, and closing the dialog any other way pops it again
// with history.back(), whose popstate is ignored. A dialog opened before that popstate lands gets its
// sentinel once it has (the pop cannot be cancelled), and an in-app navigation from the sentinel
// replaces it instead of pushing a second entry on top (takeDialogSentinelEntry).
